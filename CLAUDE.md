# Radiant by Provenance — Repository Operating Manual

Vite + React 19 single-page app. No TypeScript. All styling is inline JSX + CSS variables from `index.css`.

**Commands:**
- `npm run dev` — development server
- `npm run build` — must pass clean before any phase is complete

---

## Current Target: V2.2

All active development follows `v2.2-architecture-migration-spec.md` in the repo root. **That spec is the single source of truth** for what V2.2 is and how to build it. Read it first; return to this file only for repo conventions.

V2.2 introduces two core corrections to V2.1: (1) Assets are distinct from Claims and exist as first-class parent-layer nodes, (2) Evaluation Agreements gate Claim visibility between parties. See spec §1 for the full summary.

### Feature flag

- `V2_2_ENABLED` controls which mode renders.
  - `false` (default during migration) → V2.1 behavior, unchanged.
  - `true` → V2.2 behavior per the spec.
- V2.1 code paths remain functional until Phase 7 completes. Do not delete V2.1 code during the migration.

### File layout

- `src/v2/` — active V2.1 and V2.2 code. All migration work happens here and in `src/components/`.
- `src/v3/` — archived V3 (reference for UI patterns only, not active).
- V1 files (`src/App.jsx`, `src/data/`, `src/components/Header.jsx`, etc.) — archived, delete after Phase 7.
- `tokens.js`, `index.css` — shared across versions.
- Entry points: `/v2.html` (primary), `/v3.html` (reference), `/index.html` (archived V1).

### V2.1 conventions reference

For components carrying forward unchanged from V2.1 (roughly 80% of the codebase — canvas, boot, modal framework, notifications, child layer mechanics), V2.1 conventions still apply. See `CLAUDE-v2.1-archive.md` for the full V2.1 doc.

## Forbidden Changes (from spec §14.3)

Do not, without explicit approval:

- Add new node types beyond spec §3.
- Add a second edge type — the Agreement Edge is the only edge type. Do not introduce separate Ownership, Proof-of-Evaluation, or Public Directory edge types; those are all modeled as implicit Disclosure Agreements on the same edge primitive.
- Change the data model in `v2Data.js` beyond what spec §12.5 specifies.
- Alter the boot sequence.
- Alter child layer dive/surface behavior or delete child layer code. The child layer is intentionally retained but unused in V2.2 (see spec §5).
- Remove or substantially rework the notification system.
- Unify Parsing and Evaluating processes in V2.2. That's §17.1 future work; for V2.2, maintain them as separate processes with structurally identical UI.

---

## Working Conventions

### Autonomous workflow

- Work at `xhigh` effort.
- Perform a structured review against the phase's acceptance criteria before declaring the phase complete. Walk each criterion in the spec's Phase N section and verify it is met; surface any failures in the completion report.
- When you hit a genuine ambiguity (an actual contradiction between spec sections, or a missing piece of information you need to make a correct decision), **stop and surface it.** Do not guess.
- Review happens at phase boundaries, not mid-phase. Andrew reviews completed phases against their acceptance criteria.

### Code style

- CSS variables always; never hardcode colors. Use `color-mix()` for alpha blends.
- SVG icons only. Unicode symbols (✓, ×, ▸, ◂, ■, ◆, ◇) are acceptable. No emojis.
- Timestamps use `date` + `dateTime` fields. Display format: `YYYY-MM-DD · HH:MM UTC`.
- Escape key handling: input/textarea focused → blur only; editor mode → exit to view; nothing focused → close modal.
- Click-to-copy on all PIN displays with visual feedback.
- No category labels on node cards (PRODUCT, PROCESS, etc.). Type labels (`ASSET`, `CLAIM`, `PARSE RESULT`, `EVAL RESULT`) in mono font, informational only — see spec §3.

### Demo actors

- **Bob Donloe** @ GovCo (buyer) — DOT: `DONLOE.BOB.J.1384297560`
- **Alice Nakamura** @ MicroCo (supplier)
- **Carol** @ AuditCo (auditor) — added in V2.2
- Role switching via user menu; does not replay boot animation.

### Boot sequence

CAC login → Prime Radiant 3D → golden ripple → network build animation. Session storage key: `radiant-v2-booted`. Shared across V2.1 and V2.2.

### Phase 1 completion notes (2026-04-17)

- Split V2.2 data model into a new file `src/v2/v2_2Data.js` (spec §12.5 says v2Data.js "will grow substantially"; keeping V2.1 and V2.2 data side-by-side during migration is cleaner in separate files). `v2Data.js` is unchanged; `V2App.jsx` has two additions only: an import of `V2_2_ENABLED` and a conditional banner.
- Added the six §10 factories (`makeAsset`, `makeParseResult`, `makeClaim`, `makeDisclosureAgreement`, `makeEvaluationAgreement`, `makeEvaluationResult`) plus helpers per §12.5: `makeInternalDisclosureAgreement`, `makeProofOfEvalDisclosureAgreement`, `makePublicDirectoryDisclosureAgreement`. Also added a small `makeActor` helper for dataset bookkeeping.
- Shared artifact set (`buildV22SharedArtifacts`) seeds Bob, Alice, Carol, and the Radiant Network pseudo-actor; 7 Assets; 3 Parse Results; 3 Claims; 25 Disclosure Agreements (ownership, claim→asset refs, 3 explicit inter-party, 3 public-directory, 2 proof-of-eval, 2 eval-ownership); 3 Evaluation Agreements; 2 Evaluation Results (Bob's MIL-PRF result, Carol's audit result). This covers Story 1 and seeds Stories 2–3.
- View builders `buildAliceView`, `buildBobView`, `buildCarolView` are Phase 1 stubs — they return `{ actor, shared }` unfiltered; per-role filtering lands in Phase 2.
- Feature flag: `V2_2_ENABLED` in `v2_2Data.js`. Default is `false` (V2.1 behavior unchanged). Two ways to enable: flip `FORCE_V2_2 = true` in the file for local dev, or set `VITE_V2_2_ENABLED=true` in the env.
- **Schema resolution (post-review):** spec §10.4 was updated to replace the Disclosure Agreement's `claimId` field with `subject: { kind: 'asset' | 'claim' | 'evalResult' | 'parseResult', id }`. `makeDisclosureAgreement` + helpers and the seeded dataset were updated accordingly. See the spec §10.4 subject-assignment table for Phase 2's edge-derivation model.
- **Workflow note (post-review):** CLAUDE.md and the spec were updated to replace references to `/ultrareview` with "perform a structured review against the phase's acceptance criteria." Manual review remains the process.

### Phase 2 completion notes (2026-04-17)

- All V2.2 rendering work landed in `src/v2/v2_2Data.js` (role-filtered views, edge derivation, canvas adapter with layout), `src/v2/V2App.jsx` (roleData branch on `V2_2_ENABLED`, short-circuit of the V2.1 merge pipeline in V2.2 mode), and `src/v2/AssetNode.jsx` (type-label badge in the full card and mini card).
- **Role filtering** (`buildViewForActor`): owner sees own Assets, Claims, Parse Results, and Eval Results; pulled-in Claims appear on grantee's canvas via paired DA + EA; counterparty Assets are asymmetric per §6.1 vs §6.4 — the grantee-side anchor (`granteeAssetId`) is pulled in on the grantor's canvas, but the grantor's individual Assets are NOT pulled in on the grantee's canvas.
- **Edge derivation** (`deriveAgreementEdges`): single algorithm walks DAs and emits Agreement Edges per spec §10.4 subject-assignment table. Each edge carries `{ from, to, sdaType, disclosureAgreementId, pairedEvaluationAgreementId }` — `pairedEvaluationAgreementId` is populated when an EA references the DA, wiring Phase 3's edge menu.
- **Canvas adapter** (`buildV22Canvas`): converts view → `{ nodes, edges, nodeMap }` with deterministic column-based layout. Claim health rollups and Eval Result health minibars computed from evaluation results, excluding `na` rows per §3.5. `v22Type` and `v22Artifact` fields added to each node.
- **AssetNode.jsx type labels**: small mono badges (`ACTOR`, `ASSET`, `CLAIM`, `PARSE RESULT`, `EVAL RESULT`) rendered inline before the node name in both full-card and mini-card views. Hidden for V2.1 nodes (absent `v22Type`), so V2.1 rendering is visually unchanged.
- **V2App**: `roleData` branches on `V2_2_ENABLED`; when true, the V2.1 merge/roll-up useMemo short-circuits and passes the pre-built `{ nodes, edges, nodeMap }` straight through. `pendingRequests` and `existingCascades` are empty arrays in V2.2 mode (phase 4+ features).
- **Known scope boundaries (not bugs):** edge clicks still follow V2.1 behaviour (Phase 3); the existing Detail Panel may render unfamiliarly for Parse Result / Eval Result parent-layer nodes until Phase 3; modal actions triggered from V2.2 node footers will open V2.1 modals that are not wired to V2.2 state — those rewires come in Phase 4+.

### Phase 3 completion notes (2026-04-17)

- **Pre-Phase-3 adjustments folded in:**
  - *Orphaned Eval Result ownership:* `buildViewForActor` grew a second-pass inclusion for counterparty internal DAs whose endpoints are all visible on the actor's canvas. Today it applies to Eval-Result ownership DAs (subject=evalResult + scope.assetIds non-empty). Concretely: Alice's canvas now renders `erBobPrm ↔ asset-bob-avionics` and `erCarolPrm ↔ asset-carol-audit-workspace` ownership edges in addition to the Proof-of-Evaluation edges, resolving the "orphaned Eval Result" feedback without adding a new edge type or pulling in counterparty Actor nodes.
  - *Multi-line node label:* `v22Type` badge moved to its own line (Row 0) above the name on the full card; mini-card title stacks the badge above the name vertically. Name is no longer truncated by the inline badge.
- **Phase 3 proper:**
  - `V2Canvas.jsx`: `selectedEdgeId` + `onEdgeClick` props. `handleBackgroundClick` raycasts against the edge group; if a line hits, it emits `onEdgeClick(edgeId, { x, y })`. A dedicated `useEffect` applies the §4.4 selected-edge treatment (40% white blend + 0.5px stroke) by mutating existing edge materials, so no buildEdges refactor was needed.
  - `src/v2/EdgeMenu.jsx` (new): portal-rendered contextual menu anchored at click coords. Offers "View Disclosure Agreement" (always) and "View Evaluation Agreement" (when paired). Closes on outside click, Escape, or item select. Viewport-clamped positioning.
  - `src/components/DetailPanel/DisclosureAgreementDetailPanel.jsx` (new): slide-over panel at zIndex 55. Header label branches across Internal / Proof-of-Evaluation / Public-Directory / inter-party variants per §4.1. Renders Parties, Subject, Grantee Anchor, Type & Scope, Terms, Status, Amendments count. "View paired Evaluation Agreement →" quick-jump when paired. Amend action in footer, enabled only when `activeParty === grantor.party`.
  - `src/components/DetailPanel/EvaluationAgreementDetailPanel.jsx` (new): same structure, renders §10.5 fields (authorized requirements sets, restrictions, terms, incentives) and quick-jumps back to the paired DA.
  - `resolveAgreementsForEdge(edgeId, view, edges)` in `v2_2Data.js`: single lookup that returns `{ edge, disclosureAgreement, evaluationAgreement }`.
  - V2App wiring: tracks `selectedEdgeId`, `edgeMenu`, `openAgreement`. Clears edge selection when a node is selected (§4.4). Amend callbacks are stubs with a Phase 6 comment — the buttons are surfaced per acceptance criterion but do not yet mutate state.
- **V2.1 mode regression check:** `onEdgeClick` is only passed to V2Canvas when `V2_2_ENABLED` is true; `handleBackgroundClick` short-circuits edge hit-testing when the prop is absent. V2.1 background-click → deselect behaviour is unchanged.
- **Ambiguity resolved during Phase 3:** on Alice's canvas, should Carol's ownership of her Eval Result be conveyed via a pulled-in Carol Actor node or via the existing eval-ownership DA's edge? Chose the latter (no new node, no new edge type, pre-existing DA, both endpoints already visible) rather than the former (violates §6.4's "counterparty internals are private" spirit). Documented as the second-pass inclusion rule.
